## Project Overview
This backend-only project focuses on implementing CRUD operations. It is important to note that GraphQL is not a requirement for the third demo, but will be included in the final exam.

## Third Demo Requirements
- REST API handling structured JSON data.
- CRUD operations support, including merge support and cascaded delete.
- REST API validation.
- JSON Schema for the data model.
- Advanced REST API operations like 'update if not changed'.
- Key/value data storage.
- Search and join using Elastic, with Parent-Child indexing.
- Queueing system implementation.
- Security measures.

## Additional Notes
The demo should demonstrate the functioning of the patch operation up to the indexing level.
